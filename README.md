* Node.js (backend)

# Learning (what new things you will need to learn?)
* Learn and apply websockets using Socket.io
* Gain a more solid understanding of React
* Learn how to create a clean UI
* Learn about what sorts of coding challenges are possible, enjoyable, and educational

# Responsibilities (what each member will be responsible for?)
Each person's responsibilities are explained in more detail in the milestones.  However in general:
* Michael - Client work, routing, UI basics and bug fixes. 
* Dawson - Make it cut-throatingly competitive, UI, colorscheming, and logo creation.

#Milestones
  these live in "milestones"
  
#Q.A.
- Why would I ever do this?
  * Coder quick decision making (dinner/beer/etc.)
  * Code competition practices
  * For fun / Bragging Rights

- How do you determine the problems?
  * Javascript for now - it's easy
  * Trial and Error (are some of the problems impossible?)
  * Finding golf challenges around the web

- UI - does it suck?
  * No
  * Possibly show an end goal/render, and have the user try to implement the result. 
  * Console? Possibly

- How many questions are there?
  * Approximately 40 - hopefully more to come.

- How are the questions tested?
  * Unit testing based on >5 test cases.

- When does the challenge end?
  * Whoever completes the challenge successfully first.

- How are the people connected?
  * Websockets!
  * Socket.io

- What question types will we have?
  * Basic Arithmetic (ex. Return var1 added with var2)
  * Conditionals (ex. Return true if var1 is positive, false otherwise) 
  * Ternary (ex. Return the larger between var1 and var2) 
  * Builtin JS Magic (ex. Returned the reversed input array)
  * Array things (ex. Return the first element of the array)
